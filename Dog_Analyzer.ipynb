        "\n",
        "The Dog Condition Analyzer is a machine learning-based application designed to predict potential health conditions in dogs based on textual clinical notes or observed symptoms. This tool can assist veterinarians, pet owners, or animal care professionals in quickly identifying likely conditions, enabling timely intervention and care.\n",

        "Pet owners may struggle to interpret symptoms or decide when to consult a vet.\n",
